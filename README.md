# spoofAugment

Spoof Audio Augmentations code for "Mel-spectrogram image-based end-to-end audio deepfake detection under channel-mismatched conditions". 
As mentioned in the paper, this repository provides a curated battery of audio augmentations designed to mimic artefacts introduced by several speech generative models used for audio spoofing.

The following figure provides random spectrogram visualization of some of the spoof augmentations applied to a single original bonafide audio: ![](/examples/Spoof_Augmentations.png)
